Instead of categorizing a song whose genre matches the profile's Favorite genre 
into the Hype playlist, boost the songs visibility by highlighting it and keep 
it in its respective playlist based on energy.

Under the "Hype playlist title", create a subheader or text that explains how 
the Hype min energy and Chill max energy conditions determine how each song is 
categorized in a playlist based on energy. This feature is not intuitive to the 
user as it stands.

If not done already, when a song's energy is in the ambiguous middle range amongst the Hype min energy 
and Chill max energy conditions, place it in Mixed.

The results of a search query should be by song title or artist.

As the user types in a search query, the playlist should update in real-time.

Condense the Hype min energy and Chill max energy sliders into a single double 
range slider that reflects the lower range as "Chill", the middle range as "Mixed", 
and the outer range as "Hype".
